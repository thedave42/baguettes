# Baguettes

Originally from [Paul Hollywood's Baguette Recipe](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/paul-hollywood-baguettes/)

This variation uses a sourdough starter instead of instant yeast.  

## Ingredients

- Olive oil for greasing
- 300g poolish sourdough starter
- 350g strong whiite bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 10g salt
- 190g cool water

## Equipment

- Freestanding mixer with dough hook
- Couche (or some sort of dish towel)
- 2 1/2 L square(ish) plastic container
- Dough scraper

## Method

1. Add flour, starter, and salt to the mixer bowl.  Throw is a dash of olive oil as well.
2. Add around 3/4 of the water, and begin mixing on a slow speed.  As the dough comes together slowly add the rest of the water.
3. Once the dough is together, continue to mix on a medium/high speed until the dough is glossy and elastic (use the window test)
4. While you're waiting for the mixer, lightly grease the plastic container with some olive oil
5. Weigh the empty pastic container
6. Tip the dough into the plastic container, cover, and leave to proof until it has doubled in size (usually 1-2 hrs).  It is important to do this by sight since the how active your starter is will determine how fast it rises.
7. Weigh the filled, plastic container, figure out the total weight of your dough and divide that by four. (usually ends up around 215g)
8. Dredge the couche in flour, and lightly dust your work surface with flour.
9. Tip the dough out on the flour your just laid down, and dust the top with a little as well.
10. Tap it down as close to a square or rectangle as you can and divide it roughly into four.
11. It will be very sticky where you cut it, but you should be able to pick up the dough by the floured parts.  Do that, and even out the weights so all four are roughly the same weight.
12. Now [shape each piece into a baguette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRDL3lPQSkc) and lay it on the couche.  You will fail at the shaping many times.  Don't worry, it still tastes good when it's wrong.
13. Start warming up your oven.  465F or 240C (no convection/fan).  Place a cast iron pan or large metal tray on the bottom rack of the oven. You'll fill this with water when you put the baguettes in the oven to create steam.  It helps make a crispy crust.
14. Leave the baguettes for a second proof until they've doubled in size.  They should slowly spring back if you lightly touch them with your finger, and start to have a smooth outter surface.  This is roughly and hour but again will vary based on your starter.
15. Move the baguettes from the couche to your baking sheet.  This isn't easy.  They will deflate if you handle them wrong.  It's such a PITA that bakerys have a [tool](https://breadtopia.com/store/baguette-flipping-board/) for it.  I use an old cedar plank I had for cooking salmon.
16. Once they're on the baking sheet and can just be slid into the over, [score the baguettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QdzHuhJ-ls). This will also require loads of practice.  The narrow angle of the blade (30 degrees) to the surface you're cutting is something I've found to be key in getting a smooth cut.  You also want the cut to "open up".  If you see them start to reseal you can feather them up with the blade.
17. Now, fill a container with water to pour into the hot pan put in the over earier.  Open the over, place the baking sheet inside with the baguettes running back to front, pour the hot water into the pan, and quickly shut the over to trap the steam.  The steam is most important in the first 5 minutes.
18. Cook the baguettes for 18 minutes, turn them 180 degrees around so the other side faces the back of the oven, and cook for another 8 minutes or until they're golden brown.
19. Turn off the oven, crack the door, and leave to cool in the oven for 10 minutes.
20. Transfer to a rack to continue cooling.
